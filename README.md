# Alternative Lecture Recorder

This project aims to provide an alternative to lecture recording sites like MediaSite by offering lectures the ability to pause and edit their recordings.

## Project Description

When a recording of a lecture is uploaded to a site, the recordings will automatically be published to the respective course within 48 hours UNLESS a lecturer pauses the automatic publishing for that lecture. While paused, the lecturer is able to edit the recording using an embedded video editor.
